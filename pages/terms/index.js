                                <h3>Important Information</h3>
                                <p>You consent to these General Terms of Use as well as the terms of our Privacy Policy by using our app. Hotelwaze should be contacted if you have any questions about these terms or a car rental.</p>
                                <p>When you make a car reservation via our app, you consent to and accept all of the terms and conditions on it, including the Terms & Price information, so make sure you read and understand everything.</p>
                                <p>We reserve the right to change these terms at any time.</p>
                                <p>The information above constitutes a request to Hotelwaze to locate a car rental offer from one of our many rental partners.</p>
                                <p>Any contract you enter into at the local destination is solely between you and the rental partner; Hotelwaze is not a party to this contract in any way.</p>
                                <p>Our rental partner will send the car to you directly, and we will serve as your agent.</p>
                                <p>Your signature on any rental contract agreement is irrefutable evidence of your approval of the rental partner’s services and conditions, as well as the laws of the country in which the rental will take place.</p>
                                <h3>Liability</h3>
                                <p>In the event that any issues with the terms of your contract occur, Hotelwaze takes no responsibility for the rental partner&lsquo;s failure to supply the rental car. We will not have any reimbursement or refund for any costs incurred as a result of a change in your arrangements.</p>
                                <p>The preceding is legally binding and extends to all contracts involving the provision of our services, except any other guarantees or conditions. Hotelwaze&lsquo;s actions would not imply compliance with any other terms or conditions.</p>
                                <p>Our responsibility to you, if any, in the event of a dispute between you and Hotelwaze is limited to the original sum paid to us.</p>
                                <h3>Indirect loss</h3>
                                <p>Hotelwaze is not responsible for any indirect losses that arise as a result of the primary loss or harm and are not foreseeable by you, the renter, or Hotelwaze. We are therefore not responsible for any lost income, lost opportunities, consequential losses, loss of reputation, penalties, or charges incurred as a result of the issue.</p>
                                <h3>Irresistible Force</h3>
                                <p>Due to any unforeseen or destructive situation fairly beyond our control, hindered or prevented as a consequence of force majeure, Hotelwaze cannot be held liable for the failure to deliver the obligations expected under or pursuant to this booking for any purpose. The booking and all insurances become void in the event of Force Majeure.</p>
                                <p>We will do our utmost to redirect your verified booking to another rental partner if the local provider is unable to fulfill its obligations in supplying the vehicle due to insolvency. This might not be possible during peak hours. In the event that we do not have an alternative supplier, you will be informed, the booking will be cancelled, and the advance payment and all other payments will be forfeited.</p>
                                <p>Hotelwaze does not guarantee the accuracy or validity of any travel details or links on its website. You use such tools at your own risk.</p>
                                <p>Our app is usually accessible 24 hours a day. Due to system maintenance, upgrading, or circumstances outside Hotelwaze&lsquo;s control, the software may be temporarily inaccessible on rare occasions. The customer service line can be contacted for assistance.</p>
                                <p>Booking rates for a rental car are calculated based on the information you provide, so their accuracy is entirely dependent on your input.</p>
                                <p>Hotelwaze reserves the right to change the contents of its app at any time and without warning.</p>
                                <p>Hotelwaze accepts no obligation or liability if the rental provider&lsquo;s terms and conditions as shown on the app vary from those in effect at the time of pick-up. Or for the failure of the rental to take place due to the lack of or incorrect presentation of paperwork (voucher, credit card, driver&lsquo;s license, etc.) on the spot.</p>
                                <p>Hotelwaze is not responsible for any additional costs incurred as a result of paperwork being signed for and approved locally.</p>
                                <h3>Booking Conditions</h3>
                                <p>The customer will not be charged a booking fee.</p>
                                <p>During the booking process, there are no credit card fees (except for PayPal payments).</p>
                                <p>All Credit cards are all accepted on our app for bookings.</p>
                                <p>As the acting agent, we do all we can to ensure that the order is confirmed at the lowest possible price and as soon as possible.</p>
                                <p>Since we use an online system, confirmation is usually obtained within a few minutes of the booking being made (12 hours maximum, rarely more).</p>
                                <h3>Declined Booking</h3>
                                <p>If our first rental partner is unable to validate your reservation due to unavailability, we will make every effort to submit your reservation to another rental partner for confirmation.</p>
                                <h3>Booking Option</h3>
                                <p>The rental fee is charged in full at the time of reservation.</p>
                                <p>Any booking that cannot be checked is canceled, along with any payments that have been made.</p>
                                <p>Any app purchases will be handled in the local currency of the rental partner.</p>
                                <p>Any additional equipment or facilities purchased locally will also be paid in the local currency of the car rental partner.</p>
                                <p>Any remaining rental balance is charged in local currency at the destination.</p>
                                <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
                                <p>The Renter&lsquo;s First Cancellation made online via the app within 5 minutes of the rental start is free of charge. Cancellations made after 5 minutes will be charged a non-refundable maximum fee of 5% of the 1-day booking amount in Philippine currency.</p>
                                <p>Hotelwaze will charge a non-refundable limit of 5% Philippine currency for every consecutive Renter&lsquo;s second Cancellation online via Car Booking after the rental launch. On a third cancellation online via the app after the rental begins, Hotelwaze will charge the renter a non-refundable full sum equal to one day&lsquo;s worth of the car booked in Philippine currency.</p>
                                <p>*Your currency sum could be slightly higher or lower depending on the currency exchange rate used by your bank.</p>
                                <p>You won&lsquo;t get a refund if you don&lsquo;t turn up or don&lsquo;t have the proper documentation (Voucher, Hotelwaze app with pairing code, 2 valid government-issued I.D driving licenses, etc.)</p>
                                <p>Over a 24-hour cycle, the number of cancellations is counted. For instance, suppose you booked a rental car for April 21 at 8 a.m. and then canceled it. That&lsquo;ll be the first time you&lsquo;ve had to cancel. If you book again on April 22nd at 8 a.m., you will be refunded. The cancellation period has been reset, and your first cancellation will still be counted.</p>
                                <h2>Amendments and Changes</h2>
                                <h3>Changes to a Confirmed Booking</h3>
                                <p>Done via the app.</p>
                                <p>A new order is created when a change is made.</p>
                                <p>The original order remains valid until the rental partner confirms a new order (change).</p>
                                <p>The original order is immediately canceled after confirmation, and all associated payments are changed.</p>
                                <p>Please keep in mind that any changes to your reservation are completely free of charge.</p>
                                <p>When you change a not-yet-confirmed booking, the initial order is automatically canceled.</p>
                                <p>An extension of a rental booking may be done either by making a new reservation via the app (which needs confirmation from a rental partner, which is not always the same) or by contacting the local provider.</p>
                                <p>If the customer wants to return the car earlier than scheduled, Hotelwaze will not issue a refund for the unused days; it is up to the car rental company to determine whether or not to do so.</p>
